# Docker for Mac dev support for Sidecar containers

# This compose file is intended for use on Docker for Mac
# which behaves quite differently from normal Docker engine
# with regard to port  mappings and connectivity to containers.
# It will _not_ do what you want on other Docker installs.

# Requirements: You must set up an IP alias to lo0 on your
# Mac with the address 192.168.168.167/32. This is accomplished
# with:
#   sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 192.168.168.167/32 

services:
  sidecar:
    # We have to hack the hostname so we can expose the right
    # address to HAproxy as configured by Sidecar.
